## SquiggleMilli: Approximating SAR Imaging on Mobile Millimeter-Wave Devices
This repository contains limited code and data from the journal SquiggleMilli. In SquiggleMilli, we approximate SAR imaging in hand-held devices using a commerical-off-the-self (COTS) device and improve resolution using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks.
