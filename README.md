## SquiggleMilli: Approximating SAR Imaging on Mobile Millimeter-Wave Devices
This repository contains code and data from the journal SquiggleMilli. This paper proposes SquiggleMilli, a system that approximates traditional Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging on mobile millimeter-wave (mmWave) devices.
